# Math Foundations: Vectors

Robotics is built on the language of Linear Algebra. Whether it's the position of a robot in 3D space, the velocity of a wheel, or the force applied by an actuator, we use vectors to represent these quantities.

## Basics Covered:
- **Vector Addition**: Combining displacements or forces.
- **Vector Subtraction**: Finding the relative position between two points.
- **Scalar Multiplication**: Scaling a direction (e.g., increasing speed).
- **Dot Product**: Measuring how much two vectors point in the same direction (useful for projections).
- **Magnitude**: Calculating the distance or length of a vector.

## Why this matters:
Every coordinate system transformation and kinematic chain starts with these simple operations.
