# Kinematics

Kinematics is the study of motion without considering the forces that cause it. In robotics, we focus on:

- **Forward Kinematics (FK)**: "If I know the joint angles, where is the hand?"
- **Inverse Kinematics (IK)**: "If I want the hand to be at (x, y), what should the joint angles be?"

## Current Progress:
- **`TwoLinkArm` Class**: A basic representation of a planar robotic arm with two joints.

## Concepts:
- **Joints**: Points of rotation (theta1, theta2).
- **Links**: Rigid bodies connecting the joints (L1, L2).
- **End-Effector**: The tip of the robot that interacts with the world.
