# Robotics from Scratch

A hands-on, incremental robotics learning project covering perception, control, kinematics, embedded systems, and simulation.

This repository documents daily progress building robotics concepts from first principles—starting with simple math and control models and gradually evolving into full perception and planning pipelines.

## Project Structure

- `00_math_foundations/`: Vectors, rotations, and linear algebra basics.
- `01_kinematics/`: Forward and inverse kinematics for robotic arms.
- `02_control/`: PID control, state-space models, and tuning.
- `03_sensing/`: Camera models, noise, and sensor fusion.
- `04_perception/`: Computer vision and image processing.
- `05_planning/`: Pathfinding and trajectory generation.
- `06_systems/`: Real-time constraints and pipeline optimization.

## How to use this repo

Each folder contains modular code and notes intended for incremental learning.
